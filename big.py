For Data Science

Project Idea													What It Shows											Extra Tips
1. Crime Prediction Dashboard	Data collection,                ML model training,                 						Visualization	Use real-world crime datasets (ex: Kaggle datasets)
2. Stock Price Predictor Time series analysis,         	        Regression models	Python (scikit-learn), 				Maybe use real API data
3. Smart Resume Analyzer 										Natural Language Processing (NLP), 						Automation	Upload resumes â†’ ML rates them for skills/keywords
4. Disease Spread Simulation									Data modeling, 											Prediction	Simulate how a virus/disease spreads using math modeling
5. Real Estate Price Estimator									Predict house prices with Machine Learning,				Practice feature engineering + model training
6. AI Chatbot													NLP, AI/ML deployment,	          						Can use Huggingface Transformers, fine-tune basic models


For Cybersecurity

Project Idea													What It Shows											Extra Tips
1. Build Your Own Keylogger (Educational)						Understand system security + Python scripting,		    Only for learning! Never deploy it illegally!
2. Basic Vulnerability Scanner									Networking knowledge + Python scripting,				Scans open ports, services, weak passwords
3. Create a Secure File Storage App 							Encryption + authentication								Learn cryptography libraries (ex: cryptography Python package)
4. Penetration Test Lab 										Hands-on pentesting skills								Setup vulnerable machines (like DVWA, Metasploitable2) and attack safely
5. Password Cracking Simulator									Brute force + dictionary attack simulation				Write a simple password cracker using Python
6. Log Analysis Tool											Find anomalies in system logs							Great project for defensive security (SOC analyst work)
