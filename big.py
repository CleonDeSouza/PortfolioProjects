For Data Science

| Project Idea                     | What It Shows                                     | Extra Tips                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Crime Prediction Dashboard    | Data collection, ML model training, Visualization | Use real-world crime datasets (ex: Kaggle datasets)        |
| 2. Stock Price Predictor         | Time series analysis, Regression models           | Maybe use real API data                                    |
| 3. Smart Resume Analyzer         | Natural Language Processing (NLP), Automation     | Upload resumes → ML rates them for skills/keywords         |
| 4. Disease Spread Simulation     | Data modeling, Prediction                         | Simulate how a virus/disease spreads using math modeling   |
| 5. Real Estate Price Estimator   | Predict house prices with Machine Learning        | Practice feature engineering + model training              |
| 6. AI Chatbot                    | NLP, AI/ML deployment                             | Can use Huggingface Transformers, fine-tune basic models   |
