# 
# Beginner Level (4 projects) — 1st year / next 3-4 months
Basic Network Scanner

Build a Python script to scan IP ranges and detect open ports (like a simple nmap).

Learn about TCP/IP, sockets, and how services run on ports.

Password Strength Checker

Create a tool that evaluates password complexity based on length, character types, and common patterns.

Simple Keylogger (Ethical & Local Use Only)

Write a basic keylogger that logs keystrokes on your own machine for learning purposes.

Understand hooks, privacy concerns, and ethics.

Wi-Fi Network Packet Sniffer

Use Python libraries (like Scapy) to capture and analyze Wi-Fi packets.

Learn packet structure and sniffing basics.

# 
# Intermediate Level (6 projects) — after mastering basics
Port Knocking Implementation

Build a port knocking script for stealthily opening ports on your own server.

Vulnerability Scanner for Web Apps

Create a Python script to check for simple vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS in test web apps.

Basic Exploit Script

Write an exploit for a known, safe vulnerability in a controlled lab environment.

Automated Phishing Awareness Tool

Develop a tool to detect phishing URLs by analyzing suspicious patterns.

Simple Malware Sandbox

Create a virtual environment that safely runs and monitors malware behavior (use existing VMs or containers).

Encrypted Chat Application

Build a chat app that uses basic encryption (like AES) to secure messages.

# 
# Advanced Level (5 projects) — later stages, more complex
Custom TCP/IP Packet Injector

Create a tool to craft and send custom TCP/IP packets to a target for testing.

Web Application Firewall (WAF) Prototype

Build a simple WAF that filters malicious requests based on patterns.

Automated Vulnerability Report Generator

Develop a tool that scans a system and creates detailed security reports.

Password Cracking Tool (Hash Cracker)

Write a tool that attempts to crack hashed passwords using dictionary or brute force attacks (ethical use only).

Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenge Creator

Design your own mini CTF challenges for others to solve, covering web hacking, crypto, or binary exploitation.
