# 
# Beginner Level — 16-18
**Basic Network Scanner:**
Build a Python script to scan IP ranges and detect open ports (like a simple nmap).
Learn about TCP/IP, sockets, and how services run on ports.

**Password Strength Checker:**
Create a tool that evaluates password complexity based on length, character types, and common patterns.

**Simple Keylogger (Ethical & Local Use Only):**
Write a basic keylogger that logs keystrokes on your own machine for learning purposes.
Understand hooks, privacy concerns, and ethics.

**Wi-Fi Network Packet Sniffer:**
Use Python libraries (like Scapy) to capture and analyze Wi-Fi packets.
Learn packet structure and sniffing basics.

# 
# Intermediate Level — 18-22
**Port Knocking Implementation:**
Build a port knocking script for stealthily opening ports on your own server.

**Vulnerability Scanner for Web Apps:**
Create a Python script to check for simple vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS in test web apps.

**Basic Exploit Script:**
Write an exploit for a known, safe vulnerability in a controlled lab environment.

**Automated Phishing Awareness Tool:**
Develop a tool to detect phishing URLs by analyzing suspicious patterns.

**Simple Malware Sandbox:**
Create a virtual environment that safely runs and monitors malware behavior (use existing VMs or containers).

**Encrypted Chat Application:**
Build a chat app that uses basic encryption (like AES) to secure messages.

# 
# Advanced Level — 22+
**Custom TCP/IP Packet Injector:**
Create a tool to craft and send custom TCP/IP packets to a target for testing.

**Web Application Firewall (WAF) Prototype:**
Build a simple WAF that filters malicious requests based on patterns.

**Automated Vulnerability Report Generator:**
Develop a tool that scans a system and creates detailed security reports.

**Password Cracking Tool (Hash Cracker):**
Write a tool that attempts to crack hashed passwords using dictionary or brute force attacks (ethical use only).

**Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenge Creator:**
Design your own mini CTF challenges for others to solve, covering web hacking, crypto, or binary exploitation.
